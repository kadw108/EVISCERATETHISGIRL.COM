## [Play Here](https://kanderwund.itch.io/evisceratethisgirl)

Contains source code and assets for the horror game EVISCERATETHISGIRL.COM, originally made for [2023's Neo Twiny Jam](https://itch.io/jam/neo-twiny-jam/entries).

All MP3s and drawn/animated assets are public domain and can be used however you want.

`TweegoSource` contains the source code and full game + assets. The other folders are various notes or things I used to generate assets.
