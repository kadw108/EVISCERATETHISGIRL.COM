Ending ideas

- No ending, what I have now but with better conversation flow

Other topics to address:
- Why are you stabbing / not stabbing a fictional anime girl replica of yourself?
- Are you miserable? Do you hate yourself? Are you bored? Depressed? Anxious?
- You have a limited time to live, why are you doing this with your life?
- Can you develop a meaningful relationship with the fictional anime girl?
- Have you been here before? are you just getting all the endings?
- Will you come back knowing I'll repeat the same words over and over again, becoming less real every time?
- Is the fictional suffering you inflict on this anime girl 'real' in any sense? Is it meaningful? Can you stab the anime girl all you want with no repurcussions? Will you?
- Is the anime girl alive in any sense?
- What if she enjoys/doesn't enjoy being stabbed?
- Do you want to be the anime girl?
- In what ways are we alike/different?

- Girl shows up in real life, with a bloody knife or not depending on whether you ever stabbed her?

- You can romance the girl? Free her from her digital cage? Feels dumb

- You can enter the website and live with the girl forever? Feels very dumb
