- Fix AGAIN? on last screen so it only shows up after button clicked
- Fix audio? some youtubers have it playing weirdly
	- Add audio preload
- Make it so only one button activates the alternate 'close this site' ending
- Add dialogue for not hurting her
- Improve sin detection dialogue (trigger on any mention of 'nothing'?)
- Limit number of decos that can spawn/interval between deco spawns to prevent autoclickers from 'exploding' the game
