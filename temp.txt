I deserve this...
I deserve worse
I'm sorry
I'm sorry for being here
I'm sorry for my mistakes
I'm sorry...
Sorry...
This is my fault
The pain never ends
This is my punishment
I'm disgusting

All respite is repaid in suffering
Every day I live I accumulate suffering in a counter that ticks up without any upper limit
Everything I do hurts people
Eviscerate me
Happiness hurts me in the long run
Happiness is meant for other people
Everything I've done wrong
I can't apologize enough
I deserve worse than nothing
I don't deserve happiness
I must enjoy my suffering
I must redeem myself for my sins
I must suffer before I am allowed to die
I only hurt people
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry for everything I've done
I'm subhuman
Kill me
Nothing I do can fix my mistakes
Suffering is the only way to salvation
Suffering is redemption

Yet, I'm thankful for my existence, you know?
Life is a gift...
Or that's what they say...
