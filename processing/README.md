This is a less up-to-date version of a Processing folder I use for all my Processing needs. I'll upload the actual folder as a repository... eventually.

I used this code to generate the images and GIFs found in the [TweegoSource/export/assets](https://github.com/kadw108/evisceratethisgirl/blob/main/TweegoSource/export/assets) folder. The `data` folder contains raw images used by the code, mostly drawn with Procreate.
